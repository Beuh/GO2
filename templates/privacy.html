        The Gig-o-Matic cannot promise super high-security for any of the data. The code is written to follow basic standards, but (as with every other web site) a determined actor 
        will undoubtedly be able to break in and read the content. And because the Gig-o-Matic caters to self-proclaimed "activist" groups, there's a fair chance that somebody,
        sometime, might want to scrutinize the content. For that reason, without being alarmist, consider this when giving the Gig-o-Matic any information you don't want to see on the front page of the New York Times. Or in a dossier somewhere.
